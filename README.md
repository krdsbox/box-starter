# Box Starter
An optional & minimal starter kit for krdsbox components.

Here you can say something about your component.
How it works?, what was the inspiration?, tricks about your component and so on.

## Instructions
* Use box.json to define your component
* Include the preview thumbnail image in all components, It should have a 500x500 jpg & an optional 500x500 gif
* Present the preview layout neatly. Don't bloat the layout
* Use cdn for the popular libraries *(ex: bootstrap, jQuery)*
* Try to make few variations of the same component
* In the preview html, add buttons to variations
* Push files to `gh-pages` branch which is your github preview. We'll use it in krdsbox site's iframe
* Wanna improve this repo, PRs are welcome
